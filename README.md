This is just a ~~useful~~ ~~awesome~~ stupid Chrome extension that replaces every images on the web pages you visit by pictures of cute little kittens, using the amazing [placekitten](http://placekitten.com/) API.

Totally useless, I know... But as cute as possible !

## Installation from sources

If anyone is crazy enough to try it, this is what you should do:

* Clone me.
* On chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`.
* Check Developer mode checkbox (in the top right-hand corner).
* Click `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦` to pop up the file-selection dialog.
* Navigate to the directory in which the project is cloned, and select it.

## Installation from the Chrome web store

Just kidding... it's not submitted to the Chrome web store. :)

## How to use it

There should be a new icon display in the browser:

* if the cat is sleeping, click on it to activate the extension
* if the cat is meowing, click on it to disable the extension

So simple even your cat could use it!
